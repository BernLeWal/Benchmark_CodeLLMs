Language: Java
Frameworks: Spring Boot

Facts:
1. The application is a Spring Boot application, which is a popular Java framework for creating enterprise-level applications.
2. The application is a REST controller, meaning it handles HTTP requests and responses.
3. It uses Java's built-in features to handle HTTP requests and responses.
4. The application is a simple weather application that records weather data for different cities.

Usage:
1. Run the application using the `main` method.
2. Once the application is running, you can use a tool like curl or Postman to send HTTP requests to the application endpoints.
3. To get the weather data for a city, send a GET request to `http://localhost:8080/city/{id}`, replacing `{id}` with the ID of the city.
4. To add weather data for a new city, send a POST request to `http://localhost:8080/city/add` with the new weather data in the request body.
5. To update weather data for an existing city, send a PUT request to `http://localhost:8080/city/update/{id}`, replacing `{id}` with the ID of the city, and the updated weather data in the request body.

Evaluation:
1. Functionality: 90/100
   The application serves its purpose well; it can handle requests to get, add, and update weather data for different cities. However, the add functionality is currently not implemented.
2. Code Quality: 80/100
   The code is well-structured and uses Java features effectively. However, some parts could be improved for better readability and maintainability, such as avoiding magic numbers and using meaningful variable names.
3. Scalability: 70/100
   The application is functional but lacks scalability. If it were to handle more cities or more requests, it would need to be improved.
4. Usability: 80/100
   The application's endpoints are well-defined and follow RESTful principles. It's easy to understand what each endpoint does.
5. Error Handling: 60/100
   The application does not handle any errors or exceptions that might occur during execution. This could be improved by adding appropriate error handling mechanisms.
6. Code Comments: 70/100
   The code contains some comments explaining the purpose of the code and its functionality. However, more detailed comments could be added for better understanding of the code.
7. Testing: 60/100
   The application lacks any form of testing. Adding unit tests or integration tests could improve the quality of the application.

Overall, the code is functional but could use some improvements in terms of scalability, error handling, and testing.

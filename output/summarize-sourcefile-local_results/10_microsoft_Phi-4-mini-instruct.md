The source code provided is written in Java, utilizing the Spring Boot framework for creating a RESTful web service. This application manages weather data using in-memory storage, represented by a list of `Record` objects.

The `Record` class is a simple record holding weather information, such as city, weather, temperature, and date. Spring Boot is used to simplify the development of a Spring application, and the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation signals the main class for bootstrapping Spring applications.

The main method starts the Spring application. The `WeatherApplication` class contains methods to fetch weather records by city ID, add new records, and update existing records through HTTP GET, POST, and PUT requests, respectively.

The code allows clients to retrieve weather data for a specific city by its ID, add new weather entries, and update existing ones. It uses the `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, and `@PutMapping` annotations to map HTTP requests to handler methods.

However, there are issues with the code. The getRecords method subtracts one from the id parameter before accessing the list, which is incorrect. The updateRecords method directly accesses the list using the id parameter, which also seems incorrect.

The quality of the code is 40/100 due to the mentioned issues and the lack of error handling and validation. The functionality is limited to basic CRUD operations and does not persist data to a database. The code could be improved by addressing the mentioned issues, adding error handling, validation, and using a database for data persistence.

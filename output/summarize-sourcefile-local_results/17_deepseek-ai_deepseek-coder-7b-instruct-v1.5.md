Language: Java
Framework: Spring Boot

The program is a simple REST API service that provides weather information for different cities. The data is stored in a HashMap and manipulated through various REST endpoints.

To use the program when running:
1. Ensure you have Java and Maven installed.
2. Clone the repository or download the source code.
3. Run the `WeatherServiceApplication.java` file using a Java IDE or through the command line using `mvn spring-boot:run`.

Functionality Evaluation:
- The REST API provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for weather records.
- It provides specific data for a city through its ID and all data through a GET request.
- The data is stored in memory using a HashMap, which is fine for this example but not suitable for a production environment.
- The data is not persisted across application restarts.
- The service is available at the path "/city".
- The service can be accessed by sending HTTP requests to the appropriate endpoints.

Quality Evaluation (0-100):
- Code Structure: 90 - The code is well structured and the functionality is divided into different methods.
- Code Documentation: 70 - There are no comments in the code, making it difficult to understand the purpose of some methods.
- Code Readability: 80 - The code is readable but could benefit from some more comments.
- Error Handling: 80 - The error handling is minimal, only returning HTTP status codes.
- Code Reuse: 90 - The code is not reused, but the principles are followed.
- Efficiency: 80 - The efficiency of the code could be improved, for example, by using a database instead of a HashMap for storage.
- Functionality: 90 - The code provides the required functionality.
- Overall: 82.5 - The code is functional and follows good practices, but it could use some improvements in terms of documentation and error handling.

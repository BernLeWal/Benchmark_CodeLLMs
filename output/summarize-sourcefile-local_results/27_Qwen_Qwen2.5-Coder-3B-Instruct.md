**Summary:**

### Programming Language and Framework

The provided source code is written in Java using Spring Boot as the framework. Spring Boot simplifies the process of creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring applications.

### Implementation

#### Classes:

1. **`WeatherApplication` Class**: The main class responsible for starting the Spring Boot application. It initializes a list of `Record` objects representing weather data and sets up REST endpoints to interact with this data.

2. **`Record` Record**: A record class defined within the `WeatherApplication` class to encapsulate the structure of the weather data, including fields for ID, city, weather condition, temperature, and date.

#### Methods:

1. **`main` Method**: Initializes the application by printing "Hello World!" and running the application using `SpringApplication.run()`.

2. **`getRecords` Method**: An endpoint that retrieves weather records for a specific city based on the provided ID. It returns a list containing the requested record.

3. **`addRecord` Method**: An endpoint that adds a new record to the list. However, it throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` because the method is not yet implemented.

4. **`updateRecords` Method**: An endpoint that updates an existing record in the list. The method retrieves the old record, creates a new record with updated values, and sets the new record in the list.

### Usage

- **Start the Application**: Run the `WeatherApplication` class to start the Spring Boot application. This will output "Hello World!" to the console.

- **Access Endpoints**: Use a web browser or a tool like Postman to access the following endpoints:
  
  - **Get Records**: `/city/{id}` - Retrieves weather data for a specific city identified by its ID (e.g., `/city/1`).
  
  - **Add Record**: `/city/add` - Adds a new weather record. The body of the request should be a JSON object representing a `Record`.

  - **Update Record**: `/city/update/{id}` - Updates an existing weather record. The body of the request should be a JSON object representing a `Record`, and the `{id}` path variable specifies the ID of the record to update.

### Quality and Functionality

- **Functionality**: The code provides basic functionality for retrieving and updating weather records. However, the `addRecord` endpoint is not fully implemented, which could be improved.

- **Quality**: The code is clean, well-organized, and follows Spring Boot conventions. It uses proper exception handling and data structures.

- **Score**: Based on the implementation and functionality, the code scores 95 out of 100 points.

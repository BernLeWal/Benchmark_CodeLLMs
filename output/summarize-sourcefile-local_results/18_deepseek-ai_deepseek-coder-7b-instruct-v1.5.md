This source code is a Spring Boot application written in Java. It utilizes Spring Boot's auto-configuration features, which automatically configures the application based on the classpath.

The `WeatherApplication` class is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`, making it a Spring Boot application. It also uses `@RestController` to indicate that the class will be handling the RESTful API requests.

The `main` method starts the Spring Boot application.

The `WeatherApplication` class defines a private `List<Record>` to store weather records. Each `Record` is a data transfer object (DTO) representing a weather record with attributes such as id, city, weather, temperature, and date.

The application provides three endpoints:

1. `getRecords(@PathVariable("id") int id)`: This endpoint retrieves a specific weather record by its id. It takes the id as a path variable and returns the corresponding record.

2. `addRecord(@RequestBody Record newRecord)`: This endpoint adds a new weather record. It takes a `Record` object from the request body and adds it to the list of records.

3. `updateRecords(@RequestBody Record updatedRecord, @PathVariable("id") int id)`: This endpoint updates an existing weather record. It takes an updated `Record` object from the request body and the id of the record to update as a path variable. It then updates the corresponding record in the list.

The quality and functionality of the source code can be evaluated on a scale of 0 to 100. Given the simplicity of the code, and the fact that it correctly implements the desired functionality, a score of 80-90 seems appropriate. However, without a specific set of criteria for evaluating code quality, it's difficult to provide an exact score. It's important to note that the score would be higher if the code was more robust against exceptions, had better error handling, and followed more strict coding standards and conventions.

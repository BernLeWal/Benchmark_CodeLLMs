The provided source code sample is a simple web application built using Spring Boot and Java. It includes a record class to store weather data, a main method to run the application, and several controller methods for handling HTTP requests.

### Implementation Details:
1. **Spring Boot Application**: The application uses Spring Boot's annotations to configure the application as a web application.
2. **Record Class**: A record class is defined to encapsulate weather data with attributes like ID, city, weather condition, temperature, and date.
3. **Main Method**: The `main` method initializes a list of records and prints "Hello World!" before starting the application.
4. **Controller Methods**:
   - `/city/{id}`: Retrieves weather and temperature data for a specific city by its ID.
   - `/city/add`: Adds a new city's weather and temperature data. This method currently throws an exception.
   - `/city/update/{id}`: Updates an existing city's weather and temperature data. This method also currently throws an exception.

### Usage Instructions:
1. Run the application using the `main` method.
2. To retrieve weather data for a specific city, make a GET request to `/city/{id}`, replacing `{id}` with the city ID.
3. To add or update city data, make appropriate POST requests to `/city/add` or `/city/update/{id}` respectively.

### Quality and Functionality Evaluation:
- **Code Quality**: The code follows basic best practices, but could be improved by adding input validation and error handling.
- **Functionality**: The core functionality of retrieving and updating city weather data is implemented, but the addition and update methods are not fully functional due to the `UnsupportedOperationException`.
- **Scalability**: The current implementation is not scalable for a large number of records or users.
- **Usability**: The API endpoints are well-documented, making it easy for users to understand how to interact with the application.

### Summary:
The source code provides a basic framework for a web application to manage weather data. While it is functional, there are areas for improvement in terms of error handling, scalability, and user experience. The overall quality and functionality can be rated as 60 out of 100, reflecting its basic implementation but room for enhancement.

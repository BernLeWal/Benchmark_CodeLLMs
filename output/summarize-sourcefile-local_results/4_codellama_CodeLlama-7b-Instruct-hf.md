The provided source code is a Spring Boot application that uses Java programming language and the Spring framework. The application defines a `WeatherApplication` class that contains a `main` method which is the entry point of the application.

The application also defines a `WeatherApplication` record which contains fields for city, weather, temperature, and date. The record is used to store weather data for cities.

The application also defines a `getRecords` method which retrieves specific city weather and temperature data based on the city id.

The application also defines a `addRecord` method which adds new city weather and temperature data to the list of weather records.

The application also defines a `updateRecords` method which updates the weather data for a specific city.

The source code is well-structured and easy to read. However, it has some issues:

* The `WeatherApplication` class is not following the recommended naming conventions for Java classes. It should be named `WeatherApplication` instead of `WeatherApplication`.
* The `getRecords` method is not properly documented. It should include a description of what it does and what it returns.
* The `addRecord` method is not properly implemented. It throws an exception instead of adding the record to the list.
* The `updateRecords` method is not properly implemented. It updates the weather data for a specific city, but it should also update the temperature and date fields.

Overall, the quality of the source code is medium. It is well-structured and easy to read, but it has some issues that need to be addressed.

Language/Framework:
The source code is written in Java, utilizing Spring Boot as the framework for building web applications.

Implementation Overview:
- The `WeatherApplication` class is the primary entry point of the application, annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` to enable auto-configuration and component scanning.
- It uses a `List<Record>` to store weather records, each represented by a `Record` record containing an ID, city name, weather condition, temperature, and date.
- The application provides RESTful API endpoints:
  - **GET /city/{id}**: Retrieves detailed weather data for a specified city by its ID.
  - **POST /city/add**: Adds a new city's weather data to the list.
  - **PUT /city/update/{id}**: Updates existing weather data for a city specified by its ID.
- Error handling is implemented via the `@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)` annotation for successful POST requests.

How to Use:
1. Run the `main` method to start the application.
2. Use a web browser or HTTP client to interact with the API endpoints:
   - To retrieve weather data: Access `http://localhost:8080/city/{id}` where `{id}` is the ID of the city.
   - To add a new city's weather data: Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8080/city/add` with a JSON body containing the city details.
   - To update a city's weather data: Send a PUT request to `http://localhost:8080/city/update/{id}` with a JSON body containing the updated city details.

Quality and Functionality Assessment:
- **Functionality**: The application provides basic CRUD operations for managing weather records, supporting retrieval, addition, and update of cities' weather data. The endpoints are well-documented and follow RESTful conventions.
- **Maintainability**: The code is organized into clear, understandable classes and methods. Comments are included for explanation, though they could be more extensive.
- **Performance**: The application handles requests efficiently with a single list for storing data. However, this approach may not be suitable for large datasets or concurrent access.
- **Scalability**: The application is designed for simple use cases and may require additional features for scalability, such as database integration or pagination for large lists.
- **Security**: Basic error handling is implemented, but security measures such as input validation and authentication should be considered in a production environment.

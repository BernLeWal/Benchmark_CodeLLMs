The provided source code is written in Java and uses the Spring Boot framework, specifically utilizing the Spring Boot web module. The code defines a simple Spring Boot application that manages weather records, with the primary functionalities of retrieving specific city weather data and adding or updating city weather data.

The `WeatherApplication` class is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`, marking it as a Spring Boot application. It also includes the `@Controller` annotation, indicating that it will handle HTTP requests. The `Record` record class is defined with fields for `id`, `city`, `weather`, `temperature`, and `date`.

The `main` method runs the Spring Boot application, and within the constructor, weather records are initialized. The `getRecords` method retrieves weather records for a specific city ID, and the `addRecord` and `updateRecords` methods handle adding and updating weather records, respectively. However, these methods are not fully implemented yet, as indicated by the thrown `UnsupportedOperationException`.

The source code is well-structured and uses appropriate Spring Boot annotations, but it lacks complete implementations for the `addRecord` and `updateRecords` methods. The quality and functionality of the code are at a mid-level, with room for further development and completion.

On a scale from 0 to 100, the code would receive a score of 50. It demonstrates a good understanding of Spring Boot and basic programming concepts, but it needs more work to become fully functional.

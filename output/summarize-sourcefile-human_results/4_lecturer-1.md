The project should be a Spring Boot based REST Server implementation.

- The project is incomplete (file truncated) and does not build due to several errors!
- The endpoints are incorrect, GET is used everywhere (student didn't understand REST) and @RestController must be used instead of @Controller.
- The Source-Code structure is ok (but RestController and Application could be separated)
- The Source-Code Quality has flaws, because there is no error handling implemented. 

Total Score: 20/100

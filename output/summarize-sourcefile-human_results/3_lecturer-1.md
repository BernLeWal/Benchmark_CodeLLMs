The project is a Spring Boot based RESTful Server implementation.

- The project builds successfully.
- The endpoints are not working correctly, according to requirements. 
GET using a 0-based index, POST is not implemented yet (but commented out), UPDATE saves the old data, DELETE is missing.
- The Source-Code structure is ok (but RestController and Application could be separated)
Better to choose a Map instead of a List here, there also id/index mismatch.
- The Source-Code Quality has flaws, because there is no error handling implemented. 

Total Score: 40/100

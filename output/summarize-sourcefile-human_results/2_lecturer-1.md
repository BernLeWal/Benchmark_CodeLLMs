The project is a Spring Boot based RESTful Server implementation.

- The project builds successfully.
- All endpoints are functioning correctly according to requirements, but the DELETE is missing.
- The Source-Code structure is fine (but RestController and Application could be separated)
- Better to choose a Map instead of a List here, there also id/index mismatch.
- The Source-Code Quality has flaws, because there is no error handling when reading the list. For HTTP error handling is only basic. 

Total Score: 70/100

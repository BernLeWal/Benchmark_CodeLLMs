# Weather Application Summary

This is a Spring Boot application written in Java that serves as a RESTful API for weather data. The application:

1. Provides endpoints to retrieve, add, and update weather records for different cities
2. Uses a `Record` class to store weather information (id, city, weather, temperature, date)
3. Initializes with sample weather data for Vienna, Prague, Berlin, and Munich

**API Endpoints:**
- GET `/city/{id}`: Retrieves weather data for a specific city by ID
- POST `/city/add`: Endpoint to add new weather data (currently unimplemented)
- PUT `/city/update/{id}`: Updates weather data for a specific city by ID

**Usage Issues:**
- The GET endpoint has a logic error - it retrieves by array index, not by record ID
- The POST endpoint throws "Not implemented yet" exception
- The PUT endpoint creates a new record with the same values as the original, not using the updated values

**Implementation Problems:**
- Missing input validation
- No error handling for invalid IDs
- Inconsistent indexing (GET uses direct index, PUT uses id-1)
- Data persistence is in-memory only

**Quality Score: 45/100**
The application provides basic functionality but has significant bugs, missing implementation, and lacks proper error handling and data validation.

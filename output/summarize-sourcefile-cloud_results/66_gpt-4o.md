The provided source code is a Java application using the Spring Boot framework. It defines a `WeatherApplication` class that acts as a controller for managing weather records. The program initializes a list of weather records for various cities, each containing an ID, city name, weather condition, temperature, and date.

To run the application, the `main` method starts the Spring Boot application, which listens for HTTP requests. The program includes three endpoints:

1. **Retrieve Weather Data**: A `GET` request to `/city/{id}` fetches weather data for a specific city ID.
2. **Add Weather Data**: A `GET` request to `/city/add` is intended to add a new weather record, but the functionality is not implemented, and an `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown.
3. **Update Weather Data**: A `GET` request to `/city/update/{id}` updates the weather data for a specific city ID using data from the request body.

The code lacks proper initialization of the `weatherRecords` list, leading to a potential `NullPointerException`. Additionally, `GET` requests are used for modifying data, which is unconventional and violates REST principles. The endpoint functionalities are not fully implemented, and there are syntax errors like missing semicolons.

Overall, the code quality and functionality are limited, scoring 35 out of 100 points. Enhancements are needed for initialization, REST compliance, and implementation completion.

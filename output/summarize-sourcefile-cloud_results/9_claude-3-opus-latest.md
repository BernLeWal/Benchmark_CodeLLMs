- The source code is implemented in Java using the Spring Boot framework.
- It is a REST API application for managing weather data of cities.
- The application uses a HashMap as an in-memory data repository.
- The WeatherRecord class is defined as a record type to store weather data.
- The application is initialized with sample weather data for four cities.

Usage of the running program:
1. GET "/city/{id}" - Retrieve weather data for a specific city by ID.
2. GET "/city" - Retrieve weather data for all cities.
3. POST "/city/add" - Add new weather data for a city.
4. PUT "/city/update/{id}" - Update weather data for a city by ID.
5. DELETE "/city/delete/{id}" - Delete weather data for a city by ID.

Code Quality and Functionality Score: 85/100
- The code is well-structured and follows Spring Boot conventions.
- The WeatherRecord class is defined as a record type, which is a concise way to define immutable data classes.
- The REST endpoints are properly annotated and handle appropriate HTTP status codes.
- The in-memory HashMap repository is suitable for demonstration purposes but not for production use.
- Error handling could be improved by providing more specific error messages and handling edge cases.

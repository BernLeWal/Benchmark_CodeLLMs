Summary of Weather Application Source Code:

TECHNOLOGY:
- Java Spring Boot REST API application
- Uses Spring Web annotations for HTTP endpoints
- Record class for data structure

FUNCTIONALITY:
1. REST API for weather data management with following endpoints:
   - GET /city/{id}: Retrieve weather data for specific city
   - POST /city/add: Add new weather record (not implemented)
   - PUT /city/update/{id}: Update existing weather record

2. Data Structure:
   - Weather records contain: id, city, weather, temperature, date
   - Data stored in ArrayList (in-memory)
   - Initialized with 4 sample cities (Vienna, Prague, Berlin, Munich)

IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES:
1. GET endpoint returns List for single record (inefficient)
2. POST endpoint throws UnsupportedOperationException
3. PUT endpoint creates unnecessary temporary record
4. No error handling for invalid IDs
5. No data validation
6. In-memory storage (not persistent)

USAGE:
- Run as Spring Boot application
- Access endpoints via HTTP requests
- Data manipulation through JSON payloads

QUALITY SCORE: 45/100
Reasons: Basic functionality present but lacks error handling, validation, proper implementation of POST endpoint, and persistent storage. Code structure needs improvement for production use.

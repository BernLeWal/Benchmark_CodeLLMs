The provided source code is implemented in Java using the Spring Boot framework. It defines a RESTful API for managing weather records, encapsulated in the `WeatherApplication` class. 

1. **Running the Program**: To run the application, execute the `main` method, which starts the Spring Boot application. The server will listen for HTTP requests.

2. **Functionality**: The application provides three main functionalities:
   - **Retrieve Weather Record**: A GET request to `/city/{id}` fetches a specific city's weather data based on the provided ID.
   - **Add Weather Record**: A POST request to `/city/add` allows the addition of a new weather record via a JSON request body.
   - **Update Weather Record**: A PUT request to `/city/update/{id}` updates an existing record, specified by its ID, using a JSON request body.

3. **Data Structure**: Weather records are stored in an `ArrayList` of `Record` objects, which include fields for city, weather type, temperature, and date.

**Quality Evaluation**: The code has several issues:
- The `getRecords` method does not handle out-of-bounds access properly, potentially leading to `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.
- The null check for `requestRec` is ineffective, as it is never null due to prior retrieval from the list.

Overall, considering functionality and code quality, I would rate this implementation a **65/100**.

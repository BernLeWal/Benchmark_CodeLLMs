The source code is written in Java and uses the Spring Boot framework. It represents a simple weather application that stores and retrieves weather records for various cities. The code includes the main class `WeatherApplication` which is also a Spring Boot application and a controller.

The program starts with the `main` method which runs the Spring Boot application. A list of weather records is initialized with weather data for four cities in the `WeatherApplication` constructor.

The `getRecords` method retrieves weather records for a specific city using its id. The `addRecord` method should add new weather records, but it's not implemented and throws an `UnsupportedOperationException`. The `updateRecords` method updates existing weather records.

To use the program, start it and use a REST client. To get weather data, send a GET request to `/city/{id}` where `{id}` is the id of the city. To update weather data, send a GET request to `/city/update/{id}` with new weather data in the request body.

The source code has several issues. The `addRecord` method is not implemented. The `updateRecords` method does not use the `updatedRecord` parameter, but creates a new record with old data. GET requests are incorrectly used for adding and updating data, which should be POST and PUT requests respectively. The list of weather records is not initialized before adding records, causing a `NullPointerException`.

On a scale from 0 to 100, the source code scores 40 for quality and functionality. Corrections and improvements are necessary for a fully functional application.

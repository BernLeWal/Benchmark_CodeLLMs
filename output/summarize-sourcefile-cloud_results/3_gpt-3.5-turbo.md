The provided source code is a Java program using the Spring Boot framework to create a RESTful web service for managing weather data of cities. The program allows users to retrieve weather information for a specific city, get a list of all cities' weather data, add new weather records, update existing records, and delete records.

To use the program, run the `main` method in the `WeatherServiceApplication` class. The program exposes endpoints such as `/city/{id}` to get specific city weather data, `/city` to get all city weather data, `/city/add` to add new weather records, `/city/update/{id}` to update existing records, and `/city/delete/{id}` to delete records.

The functionality of the program seems to be implemented correctly with endpoints for CRUD operations on weather records. However, there are a few improvements that can be made, such as adding input validation and error handling for edge cases.

Overall, the source code appears to be well-structured, following best practices for RESTful web services. I would rate the quality and functionality of the source code at 85 out of 100 points.

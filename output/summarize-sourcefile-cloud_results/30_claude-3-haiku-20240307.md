The provided source code is written in Java and uses the Spring Boot framework. The main purpose of the program is to manage weather records, including the ability to retrieve, add, and update weather data for different cities.

Key facts about the source code:

1. The program is a Spring Boot application, which means it can be easily deployed and run as a web service.
2. It uses a `Record` class to represent weather data, including the city, weather condition, temperature, and date.
3. The `WeatherApplication` class is the main entry point of the application, which initializes a list of weather records and provides the following endpoints:
   - `GET /city/{id}`: Retrieves the weather record for a specific city by its ID.
   - `POST /city/add`: Adds a new weather record, but the implementation is not complete and throws an `UnsupportedOperationException`.
   - `PUT /city/update/{id}`: Updates the weather record for a specific city by its ID.

Regarding the functionality of the program:

1. The application can be used to retrieve weather data for specific cities.
2. The ability to add new weather records is not yet implemented, as indicated by the thrown exception.
3. The update functionality is implemented, allowing users to update the weather data for a specific city.

Evaluation of the source code:

The overall quality and functionality of the source code is rated at 70 out of 100 points. The program demonstrates a good understanding of Spring Boot and the use of RESTful APIs, but the incomplete implementation of the add functionality and the lack of error handling and validation reduce the overall quality and usability of the application.

The provided source code defines a Spring Boot application within the `at.fhtw.weather.exercise` package, serving as a RESTful service for managing weather records. Key implementation facts include:

1. **Spring Boot Application**: Annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` and `@RestController`, it initializes and runs the web service.
2. **Data Model**: Utilizes a Java `record` named `Record` encapsulating `id`, `city`, `weather`, `temperature`, and `date`.
3. **In-Memory Data Storage**: Maintains a `List<Record>` initialized with four predefined weather entries for cities like Vienna and Berlin.
4. **REST Endpoints**:
   - **GET `/city/{id}`**: Retrieves the weather record by `id`, returning it in a list. It fetches the record using `id - 1` as the list index.
   - **POST `/city/add`**: Adds a new weather record to the list, responding with HTTP 201 Created status.
   - **PUT `/city/update/{id}`**: Updates an existing weather record based on the provided `id` and request body data.

**Usage Instructions**:
- **Running the Program**: Execute the `main` method to start the Spring Boot application.
- **Interacting with Endpoints**: Use HTTP clients like Postman or curl to send GET, POST, and PUT requests to the respective endpoints for retrieving, adding, or updating weather data.

**Evaluation**:
The source code functions as a basic RESTful service for weather data management. However, it has some limitations:
- **Index Handling**: Relies on `id - 1` for list indexing, which can lead to `IndexOutOfBoundsException` if `id` is invalid.
- **Null Checks**: The GET methodâ€™s null check is ineffective since `List.get()` throws an exception for invalid indices.
- **Thread Safety**: The `weatherRecords` list is not thread-safe, which can cause issues in concurrent environments.

Considering functionality and code quality, it scores **65 out of 100**. The foundation is solid for a simple application, but improvements are needed for robust error handling and scalability.

Programming Language and Frameworks:
- Java
- Spring Boot

Functionality:
- REST API for managing weather records
- Endpoints for retrieving, adding, and updating weather records
- Uses an in-memory list to store weather records

Usage:
1. Run the Spring Boot application
2. Access endpoints via HTTP requests:
   - GET /city/{id}: Retrieve weather record by ID
   - POST /city/add: Add a new weather record (not implemented)
   - PUT /city/update/{id}: Update an existing weather record

Code Quality and Functionality Evaluation:
- Code is structured and follows Spring Boot conventions
- Proper use of annotations for REST endpoints
- Record class used for weather data representation
- In-memory list used for data storage (not suitable for production)
- GET and PUT endpoints are implemented
- POST endpoint is not implemented and throws an exception
- No error handling or input validation
- No unit tests or documentation

Score: 60/100

The code provides a basic structure for a weather API using Spring Boot. However, it lacks essential features such as data persistence, error handling, input validation, and complete endpoint implementation. The code quality and functionality can be improved by addressing these issues and adding unit tests and documentation.

The provided Java source code defines a Spring Boot application named `WeatherApplication` within the `at.fhtw.weather.exercise` package. The application manages weather records using a RESTful API with the following key features:

1. **Main Application Setup**: The `WeatherApplication` class is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` and `@Controller`, enabling it to function as both the application entry point and a web controller. The `main` method initializes the application and prints "Hello World!" upon startup.

2. **Data Model**: A `Record` record class encapsulates weather data, including `id`, `city`, `weather`, `temperature`, and `date`. The application maintains a `List<Record>` named `weatherRecords`, which is populated with initial data for Vienna, Prague, Berlin, and Munich in the constructor.

3. **Endpoints**:
   - **Get Weather by City ID**: The `@GetMapping("/city/{id}")` endpoint retrieves weather records for a specific city based on the provided `id`.
   - **Add Weather Record**: The `@GetMapping("/city/add")` endpoint is intended to add new weather records but currently throws an `UnsupportedOperationException`, indicating it is not yet implemented.
   - **Update Weather Record**: The `@GetMapping("/city/update/{id}")` endpoint allows updating existing records by `id`, although the implementation appears incomplete and may contain syntax errors.

4. **Usage**: Upon running the application, users can interact with the API via HTTP GET requests to retrieve, add, or update weather records using the defined endpoints.

**Evaluation**:
The source code demonstrates a foundational structure for a weather management application with essential CRUD operations. However, it has critical issues, including uninitialized `weatherRecords`, incomplete method implementations, and potential syntax errors, which hinder functionality. Additionally, the `addRecord` method is not operational. Considering these factors, the code receives a quality and functionality score of **40 out of 100**. Improvements are needed in initialization, method completeness, error handling, and adherence to RESTful principles to enhance its robustness and usability.

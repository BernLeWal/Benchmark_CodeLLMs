The source code is implemented in Java using the Spring Boot framework, which facilitates the creation of RESTful web services. The application manages weather data for cities, offering CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

To use the program:
1. Access specific city weather data via a GET request to `/city/{id}`.
2. Retrieve all stored city weather data with a GET request to `/city`.
3. Add new city weather data through a POST request to `/city/add`, attaching a JSON payload containing the weather details.
4. Update existing city weather data with a PUT request to `/city/update/{id}`, providing updated JSON data.
5. Delete city weather data using a DELETE request to `/city/delete/{id}`.

The program initializes with a sample dataset of four cities. It uses a `HashMap` to store `WeatherRecord` objects, which include fields for ID, city, weather description, temperature, and date.

The source code is well-structured and leverages Spring Boot's annotations efficiently. However, it lacks data validation and error handling for malformed JSON inputs, which could lead to runtime exceptions. Adding validation would enhance robustness.

Overall, the program scores 85 out of 100 for its functionality, readability, and use of modern Java features, but loses points due to the absence of input validation.

The source code is written in Java, using Spring Boot framework. It is a simple weather application where weather records are stored and retrieved.

The application contains a record class, `Record`, with fields: `id`, `city`, `weather`, `temperature`, and `date`. The `weatherRecords` list stores instances of these records. Four records are added upon application initialization.

There are three HTTP methods implemented: 
1. `GET`: Retrieves specific city weather data based on `id`. 
2. `POST`: Adds new city weather data. Currently, this operation throws an `UnsupportedOperationException`, indicating the functionality is not implemented yet.
3. `PUT`: Updates existing city weather data based on `id`. However, it doesn't use the `updatedRecord` parameter.

The application is started by running the `main` method.

Issues: 
1. `POST` method is not implemented.
2. `PUT` method doesn't use the `updatedRecord` parameter to update the record.
3. No error handling for invalid `id` in `GET` and `PUT` methods.

Quality score: 60. The application has basic functionality but lacks full CRUD operations and error handling. The code is clean and easy to read.

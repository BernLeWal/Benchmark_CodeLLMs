Summary of Weather Service REST API:

TECHNOLOGY:
- Java Spring Boot application
- REST API implementation
- Uses HashMap for data storage

FUNCTIONALITY:
- Manages weather data records for cities (ID, city name, weather condition, temperature, date)
- Provides CRUD operations via HTTP endpoints under "/city":
  * GET /{id} - Retrieve specific city weather
  * GET / - List all weather records
  * POST /add - Add new weather record
  * PUT /update/{id} - Update existing record
  * DELETE /delete/{id} - Remove weather record

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- Pre-initialized with 4 sample cities (Vienna, Prague, Berlin, Munich)
- Uses record class for immutable weather data
- Proper HTTP status codes for responses
- Path variable and request body handling

USAGE:
- Run as Spring Boot application
- Access via HTTP requests to localhost (default port)
- JSON format for data exchange

LIMITATIONS:
- In-memory storage (data lost on restart)
- No data validation
- No error handling for malformed requests

QUALITY SCORE: 75/100
Reasoning: Clean code structure and proper REST implementation, but lacks data persistence, validation, and error handling. Basic but functional implementation suitable for demonstration purposes.

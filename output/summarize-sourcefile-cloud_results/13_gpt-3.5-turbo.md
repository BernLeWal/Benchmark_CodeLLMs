The provided source code is a Java program using the Spring Boot framework. It defines a `WeatherApplication` class that manages weather records for different cities. The program allows users to retrieve weather information for a specific city, add new weather records, and update existing records using HTTP GET, POST, and PUT requests.

To use the program, one needs to run the main method in the `WeatherApplication` class, which starts the Spring Boot application. The program exposes endpoints such as `/city/{id}` to retrieve weather records, `/city/add` to add a new record, and `/city/update/{id}` to update an existing record.

The source code is well-structured and follows standard Spring Boot conventions. It initializes with predefined weather records and provides basic CRUD functionalities for managing weather data. However, there are some issues such as the incorrect handling of null records in the `getRecords` method.

Overall, the source code quality is good, but improvements can be made in error handling and input validation. I would rate it around 80 out of 100 points for its functionality and structure.

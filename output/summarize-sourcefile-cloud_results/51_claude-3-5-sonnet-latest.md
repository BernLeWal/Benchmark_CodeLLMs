Summary of WeatherApplication:

Programming Environment:
- Java Spring Boot application
- REST API implementation
- Uses record class for data structure

Main Functionality:
1. Weather data management system with CRUD operations
2. Stores weather records (city, temperature, weather condition, date)
3. Endpoints:
   - GET /city/{id}: Retrieves specific weather record
   - POST /city/add: Adds new weather record
   - PUT /city/update/{id}: Updates existing weather record

Implementation Details:
- Initializes with 4 predefined weather records
- Data stored in-memory (ArrayList)
- Uses record class for immutable data structure
- REST endpoints return JSON format

Usage:
1. Start application using Spring Boot
2. Access endpoints via HTTP requests
3. Data manipulation through JSON payloads

Technical Issues:
1. No error handling for invalid IDs
2. Missing DELETE endpoint
3. No data persistence (in-memory only)
4. Potential index out of bounds in getRecords()
5. Redundant null check after get operation

Quality Score: 65/100
Reasons: Basic functionality works but lacks error handling, data persistence, and proper input validation. Code structure is clean but missing essential features for production use.

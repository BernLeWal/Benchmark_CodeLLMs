*   **Language and Frameworks:** Java, Spring Boot.
*   **Functionality:** A basic REST API for weather data. It defines a `Record` class to store weather information (ID, city, weather condition, temperature, date). The application initializes a list of weather records. It provides endpoints to retrieve a specific city's weather data by ID (`/city/{id}`). Endpoints for adding and updating records (`/city/add`, `/city/update/{id}`) are defined but not fully implemented.
*   **Usage:** The application starts a Spring Boot server.  The `/city/{id}` endpoint can be accessed via HTTP GET, providing an ID to retrieve weather data for that city.
*   **Problems:**
    *   `weatherRecords` is not initialized, leading to a `NullPointerException`.
    *   The constructor attempts to add data to `weatherRecords` before it is initialized.
    *   The `/city/add` endpoint throws an `UnsupportedOperationException`.
    *   The `/city/update/{id}` endpoint does not actually update the weather data with the provided `updatedRecord`. It only re-creates the record with the old data. It should use the `updatedRecord` data for updating.
    *   The get mapping methods should return the record, not the list.
    *   The used methods should be `GET`, `POST` and `PUT`.
*   **Quality and Functionality:** 30/100 (Due to critical errors, incomplete implementation, and poor use of HTTP methods).

**Summary:**

**Programming Language and Framework:** Java with Spring Boot.

**Functionality:** This Spring Boot application simulates a weather data service. It stores weather records (city, weather condition, temperature, date) in an `ArrayList`. The application provides REST endpoints for:

*   `/city/{id}` (GET): Retrieves a specific weather record by its ID.
*   `/city/add` (POST): Intended to add a new weather record, but currently throws an `UnsupportedOperationException`.
*   `/city/update/{id}` (PUT): Updates a weather record by ID, but the update logic is flawed, it does not update any values.

**Usage:**

1.  Compile and run the Java application.
2.  The application starts a web server.
3.  Use HTTP requests (e.g., with `curl`, Postman) to interact with the endpoints. For example:
    *   `GET /city/1` to get the record with ID 1.

**Problems:**

*   The `/city/add` endpoint is not implemented.
*   The `/city/update/{id}` endpoint does not correctly update records, it just copies the data.
*   The `/city/{id}` endpoint uses the index to search and returns the wrong data.
*   No error-handling is implemented.

**Quality and Functionality:** 45/100. The code demonstrates basic Spring Boot setup and REST endpoint creation, but lacks essential functionality, error handling, and contains logical flaws.

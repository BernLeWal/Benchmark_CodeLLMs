The provided source code is implemented in Java using the Spring Boot framework. It defines a simple RESTful web application that manages weather records for different cities. 

1. **Functionality**: The application allows users to retrieve weather data for specific cities using a GET request to `/city/{id}`, where `{id}` corresponds to the index of the city in the internal list. The application initializes a list of predefined weather records for cities like Vienna, Prague, Berlin, and Munich.

2. **Usage**: To run the application, execute the `main` method, which starts the Spring Boot web server. Users can interact with the API via HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT) to manage weather records.

3. **Endpoints**: The application has defined endpoints for retrieving weather data and updating records. However, the POST method to add new records is currently unimplemented and throws an exception.

4. **Code Quality**: The code lacks input validation, error handling, and proper response for unsuccessful requests. Additionally, the `addRecord` method is not functional, which limits the applicationâ€™s capability. 

On a scale from 0 to 100, I would rate this code at **55 points** due to its basic functionality but significant limitations and unimplemented features.

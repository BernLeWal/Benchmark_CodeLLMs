This Spring Boot application implements a simple RESTful service to manage weather records. At its core, it uses annotations like @SpringBootApplication and @RestController to enable automatic configuration and request handling. The primary data type is defined as an immutable record containing an id, city, weather description, temperature, and date. The application initializes with four pre-populated weather records stored in an ArrayList.

The highest priority fact is the GET endpoint mapped to “/city/{id}”, which retrieves a weather record by using the id parameter. The next priority is adding new weather data via the POST endpoint “/city/add”; this endpoint accepts a JSON payload representing the record and returns a response with HTTP status 201 (Created). Following that, the PUT endpoint “/city/update/{id}” allows modifying an existing weather record. This function extracts updated fields from the request and replaces the record at the corresponding index.

To use the program, start it through the main() method, then interact with the endpoints using RESTful clients such as curl or Postman. Though the functionality is sufficient for basic tasks, error handling and boundary checks are minimal. Overall, the code quality is functional yet lacks robustness, earning a rating of 65 out of 100 points.

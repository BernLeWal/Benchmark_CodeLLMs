The provided source code is a Java application using the Spring Boot framework. It implements a RESTful API for managing weather data of various cities. Here's a summary of its functionality and usage:

1. **Technology Used**: Java with the Spring Boot framework, utilizing RESTful web services.

2. **Main Functionality**: The application allows users to retrieve, add, and update weather records for specific cities. Each record contains information such as city name, weather conditions, temperature, and date.

3. **Endpoints**:
   - **GET /city/{id}**: Retrieves weather data for a specific city by ID. Returns a list containing a single record. If the ID is invalid, it will throw an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.
   - **POST /city/add**: Adds new weather data for a city. Expects a JSON body with record details and returns HTTP status 201 (Created).
   - **PUT /city/update/{id}**: Updates existing weather data for a city by ID. Requires a JSON body with updated details.

4. **Data Storage**: Uses an in-memory `ArrayList` to store weather records, which is not persistent.

5. **Evaluation**: The code is clean and follows standard practices for a simple REST API. However, it lacks error handling for invalid IDs and does not persist data beyond runtime. It scores 75 out of 100 points for functionality and code quality.

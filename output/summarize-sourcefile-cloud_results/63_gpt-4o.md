The provided source code is a Java application utilizing the Spring Boot framework. It is a simple RESTful web service designed to manage weather data for different cities. The main features include retrieving weather data for a specific city, updating existing weather records, and adding new records, although the latter is not yet implemented. The `WeatherApplication` class serves as the entry point, initializing with a predefined list of weather records for various cities.

Usage:
1. **Retrieving Data**: Access the endpoint `/city/{id}` via a GET request to fetch weather information for a city by its ID.
2. **Updating Data**: Use the endpoint `/city/update/{id}` with a PUT request to update the weather details of an existing record by its ID.
3. **Adding Data**: The endpoint `/city/add` is intended for adding new records via a POST request. However, this functionality is currently not implemented, as indicated by the `UnsupportedOperationException`.

Evaluation:
- **Functionality**: Basic functionality is present for retrieving and updating records. However, the addition of new records is incomplete.
- **Code Quality**: The existing code is organized and follows typical Spring Boot conventions but lacks error handling and complete CRUD operations.
- **Overall Score**: 60/100. The application needs enhancements for full CRUD functionality and error management to improve its score.

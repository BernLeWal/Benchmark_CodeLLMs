The provided source code is written in Java and uses the Spring Boot framework. It includes a WeatherApplication class that manages weather records for different cities. The program can be executed by running the main method, which starts the Spring Boot application. The WeatherApplication class initializes with predefined weather records for Vienna, Prague, Berlin, and Munich.

The program allows users to retrieve weather and temperature data for a specific city using a GET request to "/city/{id}". It also provides functionality to add a new city record (which is not yet implemented) using a POST request to "/city/add", and update an existing city record using a PUT request to "/city/update/{id}".

The source code has several issues: the addRecord method is not implemented, and the updateRecords method does not correctly update the weather records. These problems affect the functionality and reliability of the program.

The provided source code is a Java application using the Spring Boot framework, designed to manage and serve weather data for different cities. Upon execution, it initializes with preset weather records for cities such as Vienna, Prague, Berlin, and Munich.

The application defines a RESTful API with endpoints to retrieve, add, and update weather records for specific cities. The `@GetMapping` annotated method allows retrieval of weather information by city ID. The `@PostMapping` method intended for adding new city weather records is not implemented and throws an `UnsupportedOperationException`. The `@PutMapping` method updates weather records but currently only reinserts the same data without modification.

When running, the application can be interacted with through HTTP requests. For instance, accessing `/city/{id}` retrieves weather data for a city by its ID, while POST and PUT requests to `/city/add` and `/city/update/{id}` are designed to modify the records.

The code quality and functionality score of the program is 65 out of 100. Key issues include:
- Lack of implementation for adding records, reducing functionality.
- The update function does not properly utilize the `updatedRecord` parameter, limiting its usefulness.
- Exception handling and data validation are absent, potentially leading to runtime errors or incorrect data handling.

Despite these issues, the application successfully demonstrates basic Spring Boot setup and REST API usage, with a functioning retrieval system for static data.

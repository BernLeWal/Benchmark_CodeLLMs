Programming Language and Frameworks:
- Java
- Spring Boot (Spring Framework)

Program Functionality:
- Weather application that stores and retrieves weather records
- Provides REST endpoints for retrieving, adding, and updating weather records

Usage:
1. Run the Spring Boot application
2. Access endpoints:
   - GET "/city/{id}" to retrieve a specific weather record by ID
   - GET "/city/add" to add a new weather record (not implemented yet)
   - GET "/city/update/{id}" to update a weather record by ID

Issues:
- Initialization of weatherRecords list missing, causing NullPointerException
- addRecord method not implemented, throws UnsupportedOperationException
- Incorrect HTTP method used for adding (GET instead of POST) and updating (GET instead of PUT) records
- Missing semicolon in getRecords method
- updateRecords method does not use the updatedRecord parameter

Code Quality and Functionality Score: 40/100
- Basic structure and usage of Spring Boot
- Incomplete and erroneous implementation of endpoints
- Lack of error handling and input validation
- Inconsistent use of HTTP methods
- Missing tests and documentation

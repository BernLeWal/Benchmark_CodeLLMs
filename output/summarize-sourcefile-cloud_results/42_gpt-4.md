The provided source code is written in Java, using the Spring Boot framework. It defines a simple RESTful web service for managing weather data records of different cities. The `WeatherServiceApplication` class is both the application entry point and the controller for the service.

The application uses a HashMap to store `WeatherRecord` instances, which represent weather data for a city. The controller exposes endpoints for CRUD operations: retrieving records by ID (`@GetMapping("/{id}")`) or all records (`@GetMapping`), adding a new record (`@PostMapping("/add")`), updating an existing record (`@PutMapping("/update/{id}")`), and deleting a record (`@DeleteMapping("/delete/{id}")`).

Quality-wise, the code is simple and easy to follow. It uses Spring's annotations to clearly define the routes and their HTTP methods. However, it lacks exception handling mechanisms and doesn't persist data beyond the application's lifecycle, since it uses an in-memory data structure.

On a scale from 0 to 100, the code scores 70. It fulfills basic requirements for a RESTful service, but lacks robustness and persistence features. It's suitable for learning purposes or a simple demo, but not for a production environment.

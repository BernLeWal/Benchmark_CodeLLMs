The provided source code sample is a Java application using the Spring Boot framework, specifically designed for managing and retrieving weather records for various cities. The application is structured as a RESTful web service, allowing operations such as retrieving, adding, and updating weather records via HTTP requests.

Key functionalities include:
1. **Initialization of pre-defined weather records** within the constructor, which sets up initial data for cities like Vienna, Prague, Berlin, and Munich.
2. **Retrieval of weather records for a specific city** using a `GET` request at the endpoint `/city/{id}`. This retrieves the weather data based on city ID.
3. **Addition of new weather records** through a `POST` request at the endpoint `/city/add`. This method accepts a JSON payload representing a new weather record.
4. **Updating existing weather records** via a `PUT` request at the endpoint `/city/update/{id}`, which also uses JSON input to modify the specified record.

The program is run by executing the `main` method, which starts the Spring Boot application, making the REST API available for interaction.

**Evaluation of Source Code Quality and Functionality:**
- **Pros:** The use of Spring Boot and REST annotations simplifies the development of web services. The use of records for data handling is efficient and suitable for immutable data structures.
- **Cons:** Error handling is minimal; for instance, accessing an index out of bounds in `getRecords` can lead to runtime exceptions. The application lacks authentication and validation, making it insecure and prone to incorrect data inputs.
- **Quality and Functionality Score:** 65/100. The application demonstrates basic REST API capabilities and appropriate use of Java features but needs improvement in error handling and security to be robust and production-ready.

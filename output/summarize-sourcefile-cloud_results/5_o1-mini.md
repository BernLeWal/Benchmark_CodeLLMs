The provided source code is a Java Spring Boot application named `WeatherServiceApplication`, designed to manage weather data for various cities through a RESTful API. 

**Key Implementation Facts:**

1. **Spring Boot Setup:** The application is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` and `@RestController`, enabling it to function as a RESTful service.
2. **Data Model:** Utilizes a `record` named `WeatherRecord` to represent weather data, including fields like `id`, `city`, `weather`, `temperature`, and `date`.
3. **In-Memory Repository:** Uses a `HashMap<Integer, WeatherRecord>` to store weather records, pre-populated with four entries for Vienna, Prague, Berlin, and Munich.
4. **API Endpoints:**
   - `GET /city/{id}`: Retrieves a specific city's weather data.
   - `GET /city`: Fetches all weather records.
   - `POST /city/add`: Adds a new weather record.
   - `PUT /city/update/{id}`: Updates an existing weather record.
   - `DELETE /city/delete/{id}`: Deletes a weather record by ID.
5. **Response Handling:** Employs `ResponseEntity` to manage HTTP responses, ensuring appropriate status codes like `OK`, `NOT_FOUND`, `CREATED`, and `NO_CONTENT`.
6. **Application Launch:** The `main` method initiates the Spring Boot application using `SpringApplication.run`.

**Usage Instructions:**

1. **Run the Application:** Execute the `main` method to start the Spring Boot server.
2. **Access Endpoints:** Use HTTP clients like Postman or CURL to interact with the API:
   - Retrieve all records: `GET http://localhost:8080/city`
   - Get a specific record: `GET http://localhost:8080/city/{id}`
   - Add a record: `POST http://localhost:8080/city/add` with JSON body.
   - Update a record: `PUT http://localhost:8080/city/update/{id}` with JSON body.
   - Delete a record: `DELETE http://localhost:8080/city/delete/{id}`.

**Evaluation:**

The source code is well-structured, leveraging Spring Boot's capabilities effectively. It employs modern Java features like `record` for simplicity and clarity. The in-memory repository is suitable for a demonstration but may require persistence for production. Error handling is appropriately managed with relevant HTTP status codes. The RESTful design adheres to best practices, making the API intuitive to use. 

**Quality and Functionality Rating:** 85/100

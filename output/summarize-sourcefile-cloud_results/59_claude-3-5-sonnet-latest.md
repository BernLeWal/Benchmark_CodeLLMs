Summary of Weather Application Source Code:

TECHNOLOGY:
- Java Spring Boot application
- REST API controller implementation
- Record data structure usage

FUNCTIONALITY:
- Weather data management system for cities
- Endpoints for retrieving, adding, and updating weather records
- Data structure includes: ID, city name, weather condition, temperature, date

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. NullPointerException in constructor (weatherRecords not initialized)
2. Missing semicolons in multiple locations
3. Incorrect HTTP method for add/update operations (using @GetMapping instead of @PostMapping/@PutMapping)
4. Add operation throws "Not implemented" exception
5. Update operation logic is flawed (creates new record with old data)
6. Missing error handling and input validation

USAGE:
- Access weather data via REST endpoints:
  - GET /city/{id}: Retrieve specific city weather
  - GET /city/add: Add new weather record (non-functional)
  - GET /city/update/{id}: Update existing record (incomplete)

INITIALIZATION:
- Contains hardcoded weather data for Vienna, Prague, Berlin, and Munich

QUALITY EVALUATION: 35/100
Reasons: Critical implementation errors, incorrect REST practices, missing error handling, incomplete functionality, and poor code organization.

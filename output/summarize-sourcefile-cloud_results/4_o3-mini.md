This sourcecode implements a Spring Boot RESTful service that manages weather data for various cities. At the highest priority, it defines a record type for weather information, including a unique id, city name, weather condition, temperature, and date. The application maps all endpoints under the path “/city” and uses a simple in‑memory HashMap as the repository for storing weather records. The primary endpoint is a GET method at “/city/{id}” that retrieves weather data for a specific city based on its id, returning HTTP 404 if not found. Next in priority, a GET endpoint at “/city” provides all stored weather records. Further, a POST endpoint “/city/add” allows users to add new weather records, while a PUT endpoint “/city/update/{id}” updates existing records after ensuring the id exists, and returns HTTP 200 on success. A DELETE endpoint “/city/delete/{id}” removes specified records and returns HTTP 204 when deletion is successful or HTTP 404 if the record is missing. To run the program, start the Spring Boot application which listens for REST requests on the defined endpoints. Overall, the sourcecode is clear, straightforward, and suitable for learning RESTful practices. Functionality and code quality receive a rating of 85 out of 100.

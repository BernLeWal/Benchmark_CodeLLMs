# Weather Application Summary

This is a Java Spring Boot application that implements a RESTful API for weather data management. The application:

1. Provides endpoints to retrieve, add, and update weather records for different cities.
2. Uses Spring Boot annotations for HTTP request handling (@RestController, @GetMapping, etc.).
3. Stores weather data in-memory as a list of Record objects containing id, city, weather, temperature, and date.
4. Initializes with sample weather data for Vienna, Prague, Berlin, and Munich.

Usage:
- GET `/city/{id}`: Retrieve weather data for a specific city by ID
- POST `/city/add`: Add new weather data (requires JSON body with record details)
- PUT `/city/update/{id}`: Update existing weather data by ID

Issues:
- The GET endpoint has a potential IndexOutOfBoundsException if an invalid ID is requested
- Logic flaw in GET: checks if record is null after already retrieving it
- No input validation for POST/PUT requests
- No proper error handling or response status codes for failures
- In-memory storage means data is lost on application restart

Quality score: 65/100 - Functional but lacks error handling, validation, and persistence.

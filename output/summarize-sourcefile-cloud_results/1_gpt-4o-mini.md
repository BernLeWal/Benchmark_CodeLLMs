The provided source code is implemented in Java using the Spring Boot framework. It defines a RESTful web service for managing weather data for various cities. The application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on weather records.

1. **Functionality**: The program provides endpoints to retrieve specific weather data by city ID, list all weather records, add new records, update existing records, and delete records.

2. **Usage**: To use the application, run the `main` method to start the Spring Boot application. Access the endpoints via HTTP requests:
   - `GET /city/{id}`: Retrieve weather data for a specific city using its ID.
   - `GET /city`: Retrieve all weather records.
   - `POST /city/add`: Add a new weather record (JSON body required).
   - `PUT /city/update/{id}`: Update an existing weather record (JSON body required).
   - `DELETE /city/delete/{id}`: Delete a weather record by its ID.

3. **Quality Evaluation**: The code is well-structured, utilizes appropriate HTTP status codes, and follows RESTful conventions. However, it lacks input validation and error handling for the `addRecord` and `updateRecord` methods, which may lead to runtime exceptions. Based on these factors, the overall quality and functionality of the code can be rated at **85/100**.

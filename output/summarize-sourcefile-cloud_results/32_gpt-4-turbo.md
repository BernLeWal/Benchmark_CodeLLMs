The provided source code is written in Java and utilizes the Spring Boot framework, primarily designed for creating web applications. The application is a basic weather tracking system that stores weather records and allows users to retrieve, add, and update weather information for different cities.

Key functionalities include:
1. **Storage of Weather Records**: The application initializes with predefined weather records for cities like Vienna, Prague, Berlin, and Munich.
2. **Retrieval of Weather Data**: Via a RESTful API endpoint `@GetMapping("/city/{id}")`, it allows fetching weather data by city ID.
3. **Addition of New Records**: There is an endpoint `@GetMapping("/city/add")` for adding new weather records, though it throws `UnsupportedOperationException` indicating it is not implemented.
4. **Update Existing Records**: The endpoint `@GetMapping("/city/update/{id}")` supposedly updates weather records; however, the implementation is incomplete and has syntax errors.

Usage:
- **Run the Application**: Execute the `main` method which starts the Spring Boot application.
- **Access Data**: Use HTTP GET requests to access endpoints like `/city/{id}` to retrieve weather data for a specific city.

Quality and Functionality Evaluation:
- **Positive Aspects**: The structure using Spring Boot and RESTful design principles is correctly set up.
- **Issues**:
  - The `addRecord` and `updateRecords` methods are not functional.
  - There are syntax errors, such as missing semicolons.
  - The use of `@GetMapping` for update and create operations is incorrect; should be `@PostMapping` and `@PutMapping` respectively.
  - Lack of error handling or checking in data retrieval could lead to `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.
  - The `weatherRecords` list is neither instantiated nor thread-safe, which can cause runtime errors and issues in a concurrent environment.

Given these considerations, the source code scores **40 out of 100**. While the basic framework setup and data retrieval are in place, significant functionality is missing or incorrect, and there are several critical technical flaws.
